# Gallery

A simple gallery that displays images from the local `images` directory. The
list of files is read from `images-list.json`. If that file can't be loaded the
gallery falls back to a predefined set of URLs.

## Running locally

You can simply open `index.html` in a browser or start the optional Node
server for convenience:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser if running the server.
